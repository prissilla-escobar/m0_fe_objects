# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
1. This cfu was relatively easy for my brain compared to conditionals and if statements. I feel accomplished and I am excited to learn more and tie everything together.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
1. I am struggling at taking breaks just because I don't want to end up with no time at the end of the day. I also think it's harder to come back into thinking mode when I take a break. Otherwise, everything is going good. I am utilizing my resources more (groupmates) so that I am not stuck for too long.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
1. Really just that objects are good for storing lots of info.
